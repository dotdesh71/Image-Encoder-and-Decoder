# Image Encoder and Decoder

A simple PHP script for encoding and decoding images using numerical values.

## Features
- Encode an image file into numerical values using the `unpack` function in PHP.
- Decode numerical values into an image file using the `pack` function in PHP.

## Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or later

## Usage
1. Choose an image to encode.
2. Click the "Encode" button to encode the image into numerical values.
3. The numerical values can be copied and saved for later use.
4. To decode the numerical values, paste them into the textarea and click the "Decode" button.
5. The decoded image will be displayed as a preview.

## Note
The encoded and decoded images may not be exactly the same as the original image due to the lossy nature of the encoding and decoding process.
